## BEFORE ENTERING
The Android.hpp used in this example file is freely available. :)

This example was created with the assumption that you have added a new app to MAS.    
However, if you have already added the app to the MAS, it is no problem.   
In the status of Not Live, test ads appear well regardless of the package name.  :)
